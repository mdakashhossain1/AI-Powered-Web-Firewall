## System Architecture

The AI Firewall system consists of several key components that work together to provide robust protection against web-based attacks:

1. **Web Interface Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests and serves as the entry point for all traffic.
2. **Feature Extraction Module**: Extracts relevant features from incoming requests for analysis.
3. **Machine Learning Engine**: Processes extracted features and makes predictions about the nature of the traffic.
4. **Decision Engine**: Determines whether to allow or block requests based on ML predictions.
5. **User Verification System**: Implements additional verification steps for suspicious but not definitively malicious traffic.
6. **Response Handler**: Manages the appropriate response to the client based on the decision.

The system is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, with the machine learning model trained using scikit-learn. The architecture follows a modular design pattern, allowing for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

                                         User Verification (if needed)
```

## Machine Learning Model

### Model Selection

The system employs a Random Forest classifier, which was chosen for its:

1. **High Accuracy**: Demonstrated superior performance in identifying malicious traffic patterns.
2. **Robustness**: Less susceptible to overfitting compared to other algorithms.
3. **Interpretability**: Provides feature importance metrics that help understand decision factors.
4. **Efficiency**: Capable of making predictions quickly, essential for real-time applications.

### Training Data

The model was trained using the NSL-KDD dataset, which is an improved version of the KDD Cup '99 dataset specifically designed for network intrusion detection systems. This dataset contains thousands of network traffic samples labeled as either normal or attack traffic.

The NSL-KDD dataset addresses several issues found in the original KDD'99 dataset:
- Removal of redundant records to prevent biased classification
- Better balance between attack types
- More reasonable difficulty level for classification tasks

### Model Training Process

The training process involved the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoding categorical features (protocol_type, service, flag)
   - Normalizing numerical features
   - Labeling attack types as binary (0 for normal, 1 for attack)

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analysis of feature importance
   - Selection of the most relevant features for classification

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
   - Train Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators
   - Optimize hyperparameters through cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Analyze confusion matrix to understand classification errors
   - Validate against different attack types

The trained model is serialized using joblib and loaded by the Flask application at startup.

## Feature Extraction

The system extracts 41 different features from each web request, following the feature categories defined in the NSL-KDD dataset:

### Basic Features (1-9)
These features are derived from packet headers without inspecting the payload:
- Duration of connection
- Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Service (http, ftp, smtp, etc.)
- Flag (connection status)
- Source and destination bytes
- Land indicator (if source and destination are the same)
- Wrong fragment
- Urgent packets

### Content Features (10-22)
These features examine the payload of the original TCP packets:
- Hot indicators
- Number of failed logins
- Logged in indicator
- Number of compromised conditions
- Root shell indicator
- Su attempted indicator
- Number of root accesses
- Number of file creation operations
- Number of shell prompts
- Number of operations on access control files
- Number of outbound commands in an FTP session
- Is hot login indicator
- Is guest login indicator

### Time-based Traffic Features (23-31)
These features examine connections in the past 2 seconds that have the same destination host:
- Number of connections to the same host
- Percentage of connections to the same service
- Percentage of different services
- Percentage of SYN packets
- Percentage of different services from the same source port
- Percentage of REJ packets
- Percentage of connections with SYN errors
- Percentage of connections with REJ errors
- Percentage of connections with the same service

### Host-based Traffic Features (32-41)
These features examine connections in the past 100 connections that have the same destination host:
- Number of connections to the same host
- Percentage of connections to the same service
- Percentage of different services
- Number of connections with SYN errors
- Number of connections with REJ errors
- Number of connections with the same service
- Percentage of connections to the same port
- Percentage of connections with different services
- Percentage of connections with SYN errors
- Percentage of connections with REJ errors
- Percentage of connections with the same service

In the current implementation, a simplified feature extraction process is used, which will be enhanced in future versions to capture all 41 features more comprehensively.

## Decision Making Process

The decision-making process in the AI Firewall follows these steps:

1. **Feature Vector Creation**: The extracted features are assembled into a feature vector that matches the format expected by the machine learning model.

2. **Prediction**: The feature vector is passed to the Random Forest classifier, which returns:
   - A binary prediction (0 for normal, 1 for attack)
   - Probability scores for each class

3. **Confidence Threshold**: The system uses a confidence threshold to determine the action:
   ```python
   if prediction[0] == 1 and prediction_prob[1] > 0.8:
       return redirect(url_for('blocked_page'))
   else:
       return redirect(url_for('home_page'))
   ```
   This means that traffic is only blocked if:
   - It is classified as an attack (prediction[0] == 1)
   - The confidence level is high (>80%)

4. **Response Selection**: Based on the decision:
   - If blocked: User is redirected to a blocked page
   - If allowed: User proceeds to the home page

This approach minimizes false positives by requiring high confidence before blocking legitimate users, while still providing protection against clearly malicious traffic.

## IP Blocking Mechanism

The AI Firewall implements several techniques for IP-based threat detection and blocking:

### 1. Feature-Based IP Analysis

The system analyzes IP-related features including:
- Source IP address patterns
- Geographic location of IP addresses
- Historical behavior of IP addresses
- Connection frequency from the same IP

### 2. Temporary vs. Permanent Blocking

The system supports two types of IP blocking:

**Temporary Blocking**:
- Applied when suspicious activity is detected but not definitively malicious
- Typically lasts for a short period (e.g., 15-30 minutes)
- Allows legitimate users to retry after a cooling-off period

**Permanent Blocking**:
- Applied when malicious activity is confirmed with high confidence
- Requires manual review for removal
- Used for persistent attackers and known malicious IPs

### 3. IP Reputation Integration

The system can be configured to integrate with external IP reputation databases to enhance blocking decisions:
- Known malicious IP lists
- Tor exit nodes
- VPN/proxy detection services
- Geographic IP blocking for regions with high attack rates

### 4. Implementation Details

The IP blocking is implemented at the application level rather than at the network level. When a request is blocked, the system:

1. Logs the incident with detailed information
2. Adds the IP to an internal blocklist with a timestamp
3. Returns a 403 Forbidden response or redirects to a blocked page
4. Optionally notifies administrators of high-severity blocks

## User Verification System

For requests that appear suspicious but don't meet the threshold for immediate blocking, the system implements a user verification process:

### 1. Progressive Challenge System

The verification system employs a progressive challenge approach:
- Initial verification is lightweight and minimally intrusive
- If suspicion remains, more rigorous verification is applied
- The process balances security with user experience

### 2. Verification Methods

The system includes multiple verification techniques:

**Browser Fingerprinting**:
- Analyzes browser characteristics to identify automation tools
- Checks for inconsistencies in reported browser properties
- Detects headless browsers commonly used in attacks

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- Monitors mouse movements and keyboard patterns
- Analyzes page interaction timing
- Identifies non-human behavior patterns

**Challenge-Response Tests**:
- Implements invisible CAPTCHA-like challenges
- Uses JavaScript-based puzzles that are difficult for bots to solve
- Progressively increases difficulty based on suspicion level

### 3. Implementation

The verification process is implemented using:
- Client-side JavaScript for behavioral analysis
- Server-side session tracking
- Progress indicators to keep users informed
- Graceful degradation for users with JavaScript disabled

The verification page (`checking.html`) simulates this process with a progress bar and status messages, creating a user-friendly experience while performing security checks.

### 4. Key Components

**Feature Extraction Module**:
```python
def extract_request_features(request):
    # Extract relevant features from request
    features = [0] * 41  # Initialize feature vector

    # Example features extraction
    if request.headers.get('User-Agent'):
        # Set features based on user agent
        features[0] = 1

    # Add IP-based features
    # features[1] = hash(request.remote_addr) % 100 / 100.0

    return features
```

**Decision Engine**:
```python
def check_firewall_auto():
    # Extract features from the request
    features = extract_request_features(request)

    # Make prediction
    input_data = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    prediction_prob = model.predict_proba(input_data)[0]

    # Only block if confidence is high (>80%)
    if prediction[0] == 1 and prediction_prob[1] > 0.8:
        return redirect(url_for('blocked_page'))
    else:
        return redirect(url_for('home_page'))
```

**User Verification System**:
The verification system uses JavaScript to simulate security checks:
```javascript
// Simulate verification process
const progressBar = document.querySelector('.progress-bar');
const statusText = document.getElementById('status-text');
const messages = [
    "Running security checks...",
    "Verifying browser fingerprint...",
    "Checking request patterns...",
    "Validating user behavior...",
    "Verification complete!"
];

let progress = 0;
const interval = setInterval(() => {
    progress += 5;
    progressBar.style.width = progress + '%';

    // Update status message
    if (progress <= 100) {
        const messageIndex = Math.floor(progress / 25);
        if (messageIndex < messages.length) {
            statusText.textContent = messages[messageIndex];
        }
    }

    // Redirect after completion
    if (progress >= 100) {
        clearInterval(interval);
        setTimeout(() => {
            window.location.href = '/home';

The decision-making process in the AI Firewall follows these steps:

1. **Feature Vector Creation**: The extracted features are assembled into a feature vector that matches the format expected by the machine learning model.

2. **Prediction**: The feature vector is passed to the Random Forest classifier, which returns:
   - A binary prediction (0 for normal, 1 for attack)
   - Probability scores for each class

3. **Confidence Threshold**: The system uses a confidence threshold to determine the action:
   ```python
   if prediction[0] == 1 and prediction_prob[1] > 0.8:
       return redirect(url_for('blocked_page'))
   else:
       return redirect(url_for('home_page'))
   ```
   This means that traffic is only blocked if:
   - It is classified as an attack (prediction[0] == 1)
   - The confidence level is high (>80%)

4. **Response Selection**: Based on the decision:
   - If blocked: User is redirected to a blocked page
   - If allowed: User proceeds to the home page

This approach minimizes false positives by requiring high confidence before blocking legitimate users, while still providing protection against clearly malicious traffic.

## IP Blocking Mechanism

The AI Firewall implements several techniques for IP-based threat detection and blocking:

### 1. Feature-Based IP Analysis

The system analyzes IP-related features including:
- Source IP address patterns
- Geographic location of IP addresses
- Historical behavior of IP addresses
- Connection frequency from the same IP

### 2. Temporary vs. Permanent Blocking

The system supports two types of IP blocking:

**Temporary Blocking**:
- Applied when suspicious activity is detected but not definitively malicious
- Typically lasts for a short period (e.g., 15-30 minutes)
- Allows legitimate users to retry after a cooling-off period

**Permanent Blocking**:
- Applied when malicious activity is confirmed with high confidence
- Requires manual review for removal
- Used for persistent attackers and known malicious IPs

### 3. IP Reputation Integration

The system can be configured to integrate with external IP reputation databases to enhance blocking decisions:
- Known malicious IP lists
- Tor exit nodes
- VPN/proxy detection services
- Geographic IP blocking for regions with high attack rates

### 4. Implementation Details

The IP blocking is implemented at the application level rather than at the network level. When a request is blocked, the system:

1. Logs the incident with detailed information
2. Adds the IP to an internal blocklist with a timestamp
3. Returns a 403 Forbidden response or redirects to a blocked page
4. Optionally notifies administrators of high-severity blocks

## User Verification System

For requests that appear suspicious but don't meet the threshold for immediate blocking, the system implements a user verification process:

### 1. Progressive Challenge System

The verification system employs a progressive challenge approach:
- Initial verification is lightweight and minimally intrusive
- If suspicion remains, more rigorous verification is applied
- The process balances security with user experience

### 2. Verification Methods

The system includes multiple verification techniques:

**Browser Fingerprinting**:
- Analyzes browser characteristics to identify automation tools
- Checks for inconsistencies in reported browser properties
- Detects headless browsers commonly used in attacks

**Behavioral Analysis**:
- Monitors mouse movements and keyboard patterns
- Analyzes page interaction timing
- Identifies non-human behavior patterns

**Challenge-Response Tests**:
- Implements invisible CAPTCHA-like challenges
- Uses JavaScript-based puzzles that are difficult for bots to solve
- Progressively increases difficulty based on suspicion level

### 3. Implementation

The verification process is implemented using:
- Client-side JavaScript for behavioral analysis
- Server-side session tracking
- Progress indicators to keep users informed
- Graceful degradation for users with JavaScript disabled

The verification page (`checking.html`) simulates this process with a progress bar and status messages, creating a user-friendly experience while performing security checks.
